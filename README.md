# Intentional Search

_“Reality is not observed into being — it is selected into being.”_

This repository contains the **public-facing exploration** of the IntentSim project — a simulation-based scientific experiment exploring the idea that **intent acting on information** may underlie the structure and evolution of the universe.

## 🌌 Project Highlights

- Real-time particle simulations powered by **Lovable.dev**
- Visual and mathematical representations of a proto-universe
- Hypothesis: **Intent filters information**, giving rise to emergent physics
- Peer review & AI-assisted discovery underway
