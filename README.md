[#](url) 🌌 IntentFieldSim

**IntentFieldSim** is a real-time, intent-driven universe simulation where particles evolve, learn, and interact based on a dynamic intent field. Built with **React**, **Lovable**, and designed for **AI integration**, the system explores emergent behavior, complexity, and phase transitions as a function of informational intent.

This project is both a scientific and artistic exploration into how **intent can act as a filtering mechanism** for information, structure, and behavior — from particles to patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- **Intent Field:** A dynamic 3D matrix that guides particle creation and evolution
- **Particle Intelligence:** Particles learn from interactions and accumulate "knowledge"
- **Emergent Behavior:** Cluster formation, quantum separation, and phase transitions
- **Real-time Visualization:** Smooth 2D/3D canvas rendering powered by React
- **AI-Ready Logging:** Architecture supports machine learning for prediction and control
- **Metrics Dashboard:** Tracks complexity index, entropy, knowledge, and interactions

## 📊 Core Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intent Field**     | A fluctuating 3D field that governs creation and movement of particles      |
| **Learning Rate**    | Determines how quickly particles learn from interactions                   |
| **Complexity Index** | A system-level measure of emergent structure and informational richness    |
| **Phase Transitions**| Sudden jumps in structure caused by changes in learning or intent dynamics |
| **Quantum Behavior** | Specialized particles that split off and behave distinctly from others      |

## 🧠 Future Directions

- ✅ AI-driven phase transition prediction (LSTM, Transformers)
- ✅ Reinforcement learning agents to guide intent field dynamics
- ✅ Mathematical modeling of intent as an information-theoretic filter
- ✅ Public interactive web version for collaborative exploration
- ✅ Scientific paper and open data publication
