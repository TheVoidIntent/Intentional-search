# 🌌 IntentSim: The Information-Intent Simulation

> _What if the universe is structured by evolving intent?_

**IntentSim** is a live experimental simulation exploring how **intent-driven information filtering** can give rise to complexity, structure, and emergent behaviors. This project is part of **TheVoidIntent LLC**, a private scientific research and AI innovation lab.

## 🔬 Core Hypothesis

> _Reality may emerge through information constrained by evolving intent._

IntentSim tests this by simulating proto-particles within fields of intent, where interactions are filtered and amplified based on informational alignment.

---

## 🧠 Live Simulation Highlights

- **📈 Complexity Index**: Infinity
- **🧠 Avg. Knowledge**: Infinity
- **🌀 Clusters**: 12 stable formations
- **📦 Interactions**: Over 1.4 million recorded
- **🚀 Max Complexity**: >100,000

_The simulation consistently shows signs of phase transitions, stable informational clustering, and emergent organization._

## 🌐 Project Status

IntentSim is actively collecting and analyzing data across four simulation types:

- **Baseline**
- **Adaptive Probabilistic**
- **Energy Conservation**
- **Full Features**

Hourly logs are used to map complexity, entropy gradients, and potential meta-agent emergence.
