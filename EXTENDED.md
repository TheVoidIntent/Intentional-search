## ‚öôÔ∏è System Design

### Agent Properties
- `knowledge`: Accumulated info from interactions
- `intent_field`: Probabilistic influence gradient
- `fluctuation_rate`: Behavioral volatility

### Field Mechanics
- Fields are layered, overlapping, and adaptive
- Entropy gradients steer interaction potential
- Nested fields create agent sub-populations
