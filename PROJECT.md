## 🌌 Project Title
**IntentSim: Simulating Proto-Universes Shaped by Intent**

---

## 🔍 Objective

To investigate whether **intent-driven information filtering** can lead to emergent complexity, structure, and order in a simulated environment — potentially mirroring the origin mechanics of our own universe.

---

## 🧠 Core Hypothesis

> _Reality may not be governed purely by laws of physics, but shaped by evolving intent fields that structure how information is filtered, learned, and acted upon._

This project seeks to simulate the emergence of reality itself — from entropy to structure — through simple agents learning under overlapping, probabilistic intent fields.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Particles as Agents**  
   - Each agent accumulates **knowledge** over time through **intent-aligned interactions**.
   - Particles track their own informational histories and adapt behavior accordingly.

2. **Intent Fields**  
   - Simulated as probabilistic force fields, shaping the likelihood of actions and connections.
   - Fields may **nest**, **overlap**, and **mutate** during runtime.

3. **Phase Tracking**  
   - Entropy, complexity, clustering, and stability are monitored continuously.
   - Detectable **phase transitions** serve as indicators of emergent order.

4. **Simulation Modes**
   - `baseline`: random interactions
   - `adaptive_probabilistic`: intent-influenced decision trees
   - `energy_conservation`: thermodynamic filtering
   - `full_features`: all mechanisms active

## 📊 Data & Logging

- All simulation data is logged as structured JSON files.
- Metrics include: 
  - `total_interactions`
  - `avg_knowledge`
  - `complexity_index`
  - `cluster_count`, `stability`
- Data is auto-synced for real-time analysis and visualization.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus

- Detecting **meta-intent fields** (fields that govern field behavior)
- Logging and visualizing **entropy → complexity conversion**
- Creating **intent-structured training protocols** for AI agents

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- Discovery of emergent behavior driven purely by **informational constraints**
- Blueprint for **intent-shaped artificial intelligence**
- Foundation for a **physics of will**, rather than a physics of matter

---

## 🧬 Scientific Relevance

This simulation could:
- Provide insight into pre-physical conditions of the universe  
- Offer a novel lens on entropy, emergence, and observer effects  
- Support the development of next-generation learning systems based on **intent alignment**
